#  Ember Simple Auth

__This repository is deprecated. [Ember Simple Auth 1.0 is distributed as an
Ember CLI Addon](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth) that contains
all of the previously individual parts of the library.__

This is a shim repository that keeps the Ember Simple Auth component for
[Bower](http://bower.io):

```js
{
  "dependencies": {
    "ember-simple-auth": "0.8.0"
  }
}
```

For the actual Ember Simple Auth repository see
